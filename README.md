# Crowd Counting Project

This project focuses on crowd counting using deep learning techniques. The goal is to estimate the number of people in an image by applying regression-based approaches and density estimation methods.

## Problem Definition

Crowd counting is a challenging task in computer vision, with applications in surveillance, crowd management, and urban planning. The objective is to accurately estimate the number of people in crowded scenes captured in images or videos.

## Scope / Content

This project covers the following key aspects:

1. Implementing regression-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2. Exploring density estimation techniques to capture spatial information for crowd counting.
3. Training a crowd counting model on a given dataset.
4. Evaluating the model's performance using train and test loss values.
5. Visualizing the train and test loss trends to analyze the model's performance.

## Methodology

The project follows these general steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset is organized into train and test sets. Images are loaded and preprocessed, along with corresponding ground truth counts.
2. Model architecture: A CNN-based regression model is implemented to learn the mapping between image features and crowd counts.
3. Training: The model is trained using the train dataset. The loss function and optimizer are defined, and the model is trained for a specified number of epochs.
4. Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance. The train and test loss values are computed.
5. Visualization: The train and test loss trends are plotted using matplotlib to analyze the model's performance.

## Dataset

The project assumes the presence of a dataset containing images and corresponding ground truth counts for crowd scenes. The dataset should be organized as follows:

For crowd counting, you can search for publicly available crowd counting datasets such as:

ShanghaiTech Dataset: A large-scale crowd counting dataset containing over a thousand annotated images of varying crowd densities.

## Getting Started

To run the crowd counting project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the dataset: Prepare the dataset as described in the Dataset section above.
2. Install the required dependencies: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can refer to the requirements.txt file for the list of dependencies.
3. Run the crowd_counter.py script: Execute the crowd_counter.py script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the train and test loss trends.
